            wants to get out<br>
            but I’m too tough for him,<br>
            I say, stay in there, I’m not going<br>
            to let anybody see<br>
            you.<br>
            there’s a bluebird in my heart that<br>
            wants to get out<br>
            but I pour whiskey on him and inhale<br>
            cigarette smoke<br>
            and the whores and the bartenders<br>
            and the grocery clerks<br>
            never know that<br>
            he’s<br>
            in there.<br>
            there’s a bluebird in my heart that<br>
            wants to get out<br>
            but I’m too tough for him,<br>
            I say,<br>
            stay down, do you want to mess<br>
            me up?<br>
            you want to screw up the<br>
            works?<br>
            you want to blow my book sales in<br>
            Europe?<br>
            there’s a bluebird in my heart that<br>
            wants to get out<br>
            but I’m too clever, I only let him out<br>
            at night sometimes<br>
            when everybody’s asleep.<br>
            I say, I know that you’re there,<br>
            so don’t be<br>
            sad.<br>
            then I put him back,<br>
            but he’s singing a little<br>
            in there, I haven’t quite let him<br>
            die<br>
            and we sleep together like<br>
            that<br>
            with our<br>
            secret pact<br>
            and it’s nice enough to<br>
            make a man<br>
            weep, but I don’t<br>
            weep, do<br>
            you?</marquee>
